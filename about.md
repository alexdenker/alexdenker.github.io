My name is Alexander Denker and I am a post doctoral research associate at the University College London. I completed my PhD at the University of Bremen supervised by Peter Maass. During my PhD, I worked on the application of generative models to inverse problems in imaging. My research interest include generative modeling, in particular normalising flows and diffusion models, image reconstruction and machine learning.
